# Covid-19-Vaccine-sentiment-analysis
For this notebook, we will be doing a sentiment analysis for COVID-19 vaccines using data from COVID-19 All Vaccines Tweets, collected using tweepy Python package to access Twitter API. For each of the vaccine I use relevant search term (most frequently used in Twitter to refer to the respective vaccine).
